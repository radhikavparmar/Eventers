-- cardview, recycler view


Display the contacts  without duplicate numbers and only mobile numbers . 
Eg. Suppose a contact Edwin is having five numbers out of which two are same which can be 09123456700 nd +919123456700. 
Consider them as same number only. His other numbers are 0205601234, which is not a mobile number. 
So only numbers which are mobile and non-duplicates are displayed.
